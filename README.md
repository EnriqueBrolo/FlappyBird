# Flappy Bird Game

## Description

Flappy Bird is a classic side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of pipes without hitting them. The bird automatically descends and only rises when the player taps the screen (or presses a key).

This version of Flappy Bird is a simplified implementation using Python and the Pygame library.

## Features

- Simple controls: Press any key to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
- Randomly generated pipe obstacles for endless gameplay.
- Score tracking to keep track of how many pipes the player has successfully passed.
- Game over screen displaying the player's final score and offering the option to restart the game.
